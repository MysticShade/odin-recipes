<h2>How to store Chicken Soup?</h2>

<p>You can freeze chicken soup for up to six months. Pour serving-sized portions of the cooled soup into freezer bags labeled with the date. Leave a little room at the top to allow for expansion, then squeeze out the excess air and freeze flat. Reheat on the stove.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
    <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
    <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
    <li>1 large onion, halved</li>
    <li>water to cover</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (Optional)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> <br> Place chicken, carrots, celery, and onion in a large soup pot; add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until meat falls off of the bone, about 90 minutes. Skim off foam every so often, as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br> Remove chicken from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; chop meat into pieces, and discard skin and bones.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br> Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the soup pot and return the stock to the pot. Chop vegetables into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken and vegetables to the pot.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong><br> Warm soup until heated through; season with salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon to taste.</p>
